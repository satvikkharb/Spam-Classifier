# Spam Classifier

## This project aims to classify SMS messages as either spam or not spam (ham) using machine learning techniques. We employ  Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text preprocessing and feature extraction, and then train various classification models to determine the most effective approach.

SMS spam is a prevalent issue, with unsolicited messages often disrupting users' communication and potentially leading to security threats. By developing an accurate spam classifier, we can automatically filter out unwanted messages, enhancing the user experience and security of SMS communication.
