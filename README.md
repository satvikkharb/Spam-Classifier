SMS Spam Classifier
This project aims to classify SMS messages as either spam or not spam (ham) using machine learning techniques. We employ Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text preprocessing and feature extraction, and then train various classification models to determine the most effective approach.

Overview
SMS spam is a prevalent issue, with unsolicited messages often disrupting users' communication and potentially leading to security threats. By developing an accurate spam classifier, we can automatically filter out unwanted messages, enhancing the user experience and security of SMS communication.

Features
Utilizes NLTK for text preprocessing, including tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming.
Applies multiple machine learning models, including Naive Bayes and Random Forest, to classify SMS messages.
Calculates precision and accuracy metrics to evaluate the performance of each model.
Selects the most suitable model based on performance metrics and deploys it for spam detection.
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sms-spam-classifier.git
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the main script to train the models and evaluate their performance:

bash
Copy code
python train_and_evaluate.py
Usage
After running the script, the trained models will be saved in the models/ directory.
You can use the trained models to classify new SMS messages by calling the appropriate functions or methods in your application code.
Evaluate the performance of the models using precision and accuracy metrics to ensure reliable spam detection.
